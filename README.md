# Training of Neural Networks through Particle Swarm Optimization
This repository contains all the code and presentation material used for my bachelor degree thesis in Physics.

The work focuses on the implementation of the **PSO** (**P**article **S**warm **O**ptimization) algorithm as an alternative to the classic training algorithm such as **Backpropagation**; this project was presented as experimental thesis necessary for my graduation.
